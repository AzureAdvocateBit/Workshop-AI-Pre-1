# Build your own AI powered robot

Welcome to the AI workshop and nice you might be joining!

During this workshop we have 2 paths you can follow. Both have pre-requirements!
* **Use our IoT kit** 
Use on of the IoT kits I bring (I have 12, so you might be ending up sharing one or the workshop is full)
* **Bring your own**
You can perfectly follow the workshop by bringing your own stuff.
